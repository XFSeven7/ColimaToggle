# <img src="docs/img/logo.png" alt="Logo" width="60" style="vertical-align: middle;"> ColimaToggle

A minimalist macOS menu bar app to manage [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima).  
Built because I kept forgetting to turn it off.

---

## Why I Made This

I use Colima daily as a Docker alternative, but I often forgot to stop it after work â€”  
wasting memory and running background VMs I no longer needed.

**ColimaToggle** solves this problem by sitting in the menu bar, reminding me that Colima is running â€” and letting me shut it down with a single click.

---

## Features

- **Menu Bar Only** â€“ No Dock icon, no âŒ˜+Tab switcher
- **Auto-start Colima** â€“ Starts on app launch if not running
- **Black log window** â€“ Shows `colima start` or `stop` logs live
- **Built with Swift + AppKit**
- **Works on macOS 13+**
